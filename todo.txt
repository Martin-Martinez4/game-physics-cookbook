- Create a polygon inside polygon function
  - If no edges intersect and one vertex is inside the other shape then it is contained.  
  - Check edges against edges once, then do a check for a vertex in each shape. 
- Implement contact manifold using clipping 
- May need to add an object class that has a IShape and other properties
  - Will need to make BoundingShape herit from IShape

- Implement Collision force resolution
- J norm = resolution = (-(1+elasticity)(rel velocity * norm))/(1/massA + 1/massB)
  - have a body class
    - has a shape
    - when position is updated update the vertices also
    - Implement update, applyForce and Draw functions
