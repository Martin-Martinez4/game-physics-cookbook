- Add MVT Tests
- Add test to see if shape are considered collided if one contains the other.  
- Create a polygon inside polygon function
  - If no edges intersect and one vertex is inside the other shape then it is contained.  
  - Check edges against edges once, then do a check for a vertex in each shape. 
- Implement contact manifold using clipping 
- Implement Collision force resolution
- May need to add an object class that has a IShape and other properties
  - Will need to make BoundingShape herit from IShape
